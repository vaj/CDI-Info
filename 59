Welcome to MemVerge. My name is John and I'm the CEO of MemVerge. At the end of 2022, we introduced Memory Machine Cloud. MM Cloud is a cloud automation platform that makes it extremely easy and extremely efficient to run your workload in the cloud. Our users are seeing dramatic improvements in performance while saving over 60% in cloud cost. Not only do we care about performance and cost, we care about sustainability. That's why we introduced the ability to track carbon emissions for every single workload that you run in the cloud. You can use our product for free forever and use the essentials version, or you can get a 30-day free trial of our pro version. I hope you will give our product a try. Thanks.
