Hi, my name is Sateesh Peri. I'm a developer advocate at MemVerge. Previously, I've worked as a bioinformatics developer and a pipeline engineer. Having made the transition from a bench biologist to a bioinformatician, I've witnessed many researchers need to rely on dedicated IT support to not only configure and submit jobs to the cloud, but to optimize for cost and performance. Fortunately, a new generation of cloud automation with Memory Machine Cloud is here that can configure and optimize the cloud on your behalf. As a result, bioinformaticians are now empowered to use the cloud without needing IT assistance. Additionally, this essential software is free forever and includes a starter kit of cloud automation tools that every bioinformatician or data scientist should have. Memory Machine Cloud is available on AWS and Google Cloud platforms and includes the full automated job management service which simplifies job deployment to the cloud with just a few clicks.

In addition, Memory Machine Cloud seamlessly integrates with popular open source tools like Nextflow and Airflow, to name a few, through plugins. It also supports IDEs such as Jupyter and RStudio, offering cloud rightsizing during runtime and periodic snapshots to ensure you never lose your work. If sustainability is a goal for you, WaveWatcher, part of the essentials package, now displays the carbon emissions per job. If I have piqued your interest, simply visit memverge.com and get started for free. Should you have any further questions about how to adopt Memory Machine Cloud for your bioinformatics needs, feel free to contact me at sateesh.peri@memverge.com. And thank you for watching.
